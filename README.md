## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open the react-application(http://localhost:3000) to view it in the electron chromium instance.

The app will reload if you make edits.<br />
if you make changes to the src/electron.js file should make hot-reload to see changes.

### `npm build`

This will make the react-build first and then the electron-builder<br/>
will make the final build. This generate the ./build/ folder where you can find <br/>
the app installer for the specific platform.

### `react-script`

All react-scripts are available using the prefix "react-" <br />
<strong> npm run react-start</strong>
<br/> <i> will run the react development server in the browser</i>
